                <p>Ever since the Covid-19 Pandemic, because of the quarantine, it's been harder to meet new people. With this website, this will be no problem! In this website, you can make a profile with your video game interests, by using the match feature, you can match with someone of similar interests and play a video game with them for an hour. If you still wanna talk to that person, the person's profile will be revealed and you can keep in contact. </p>
